          <p>SocratlQ aims to provide information and resources for the first-generation college student. We match high school students with a college student mentor who then can help the high schooler with SAT/ACT preparation, essay guidance and editing, as well as general information about the college admissions process.</p>

          <p>Our service is unique in the sense that we cater specifically to each individualâ€™s
            needs by ensuring a match with a mentor that shares similar interests and life
            experiences.</p>
